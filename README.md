## Change log

> We started maintaining change log from `v0.1.2`.

Instead of creating tags of versions, we have created branches so that people learning angular can easily switch branches and get the code done till a particular section of corporate training and ebook. This also make it easy to get difference (through git diff command) between branches (New code added in particular section).

Thus, versions defined below are branches, not tags.

### master & v1.0.0

Latest code, at the end of course project.

> It is recommended to read `README.md` file from master branch only.
