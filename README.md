# ToDoApp

## Change log

> We started maintaining change log from `v0.1.2`.

> Instead of creating tags of versions, we have created branches so that people learning angular can easily switch branches and get the code done till a particular section of corporate training and ebook. This also make it easy to get difference (through git diff command) between branches (New code added in particular section).
>
> Thus, versions defined below are branches, not tags.

### Change in version strategy.

Semantic Version is in form `major.minor.patch`.

Till chapter 5, 'Components continued', we were following semantic version and working only on minor version, since code is not complete.

However, code is actually complete for a chapter you are studying. Therefor from chapter 6, we will work as `chapter.section.subsection`. Therefor, next version after `v0.1.5` will be `v6.1.0`.
